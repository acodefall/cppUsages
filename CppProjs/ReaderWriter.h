		Read-Preffered logic:
		Reader threads can all read togather at the same time, where as only one Writer thread should run at any time. 
		Logic for read-preffered model is that reader-thread will block the writer-thread whenever reading is going on.



		Reader thread blocks the writer-thread by acquiring the writermutex. 
		Reader thread maintains a counter of reader-threads; and acquires the  writermutex when readThreadCounter is 1.
		readThreadCounter gets incremented by every readerThread when it starts; and gets decremented when thread completes reading.
		Reader thread releases the writermutexmutex when readThreadCounter comes down to 0.




		
		
		In fact But when a single writer is working we can not have any other writer, nor we can have any reader.
		Count the number of Readers within a MUTEX. When count is more than one, acquire the LOCK on Writer also.
		So no writer is getting called.
		We have MUTEX for reder-count and disabling and enabling Writer. Both are controlled by Reader.

		//Every reader first increment the counter under the LOCK, then goes out of the lock and reads.
		//Now the LOCK if free, if another reader wants to come in to increment the counter.
		//After compleating of reading, readers will come decrement the counter under the LOCK.
		//If the counter is 1, then Reader will ACQUIRE the writeLock also; so now one is writing.
		//COnversly when then counter drops to 0, Reader will RELEASE the writeLock
		//So we need two lock: counterLock and writeLock
